    \section{Introduction}

    The NCBI Viral Genomes database provides a large catalogue of viral genomes 
    sequenced by scientists around the world. It is the preeminent resource for
    obtaining records of viral genomes for scientific analysis.

    Yet, there is some doubt as to the extent to which the genomes catalogued
    therein can be taken as representative of viral genomes present in the
    natural world as a whole. We suspect the genomes of viruses that infect
    humans, domestic animals, and domestic plants - living things that are
    directly relevant to human life - are far more likely to be sequenced than
    the genomes of those which do not.

    The aim of this project, therefore, is to ascertain the extent of this
    anthropocentric bias in the NCBI database.
